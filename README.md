### Problem Statement

Customer Finance company, which specialises in lending various types of loan.
The objective of this case study is to identify the driving factors behind loan default which adds to huge financial loss to lending companies.

So, performed different kind of analysis on Customer attributes and Loan attributes based on provided Loan data set from 2007-2011.
## Our Analysis
- From the boxplots, we see that the employment length, open_acc and the installment do not have signifiant impact on the loan pay off capabilities of the borrower.
- From the pointplots above we see there is indeed some correlations between the loan_amnt,int_rate, annual_income, dti, inq_last_6mths, revol_util and total_acc.
- From the line plots we see that purpose and home_ownership do not have any influence on the loan status, but, Grade and term have. 
- Defaulters had lower installement amounts over a longer term as compared to the borrowers who paid fully.
- The loan amount to annual income  ratio for Defaulters are higher!
- The open_acc to total_acc ratio(open credit lines to total credit lines of the borrower) for Defaulters are higher!
- Long credit history obviously means the borrower is more likely to payoff and less likely to default.

## Conclusions
Most important driving factors for loan default :

Loan Amount to Annual Income ratio
Credit Line history
Grade
Open Account to Total account ratio
Installment to loan term ratio
