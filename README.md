### Investment Analysis
### Problem Statement
As an asset management company,we want to make investments in a few companies. We want to understand the global trends in investments so that we can take the investment decisions effectively. 
We have two minor constraints for investments:
- It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment
- It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in.

Our Strategy is to invest where most other investors are investing.
